### About Jahaziel Israel

Recently, a mentor gave me an inspiring and eye-opening book entitled "How the World See's You". The author Sally Hogshead developed a very intuitive assessment that determines your "fascination level", and the overarching belief in the book is that the greatest value you can add to any person or organization is to become more of your authentic self.

According to my _Fascination Advantage® Assessment_ results, my primary advantage is **Passion**, the language of relationships — which means I create warm emotional connections. My main attributes are confidence, being goal-oriented and decisive.

The gifts that I will bring to the role of a developer are that I connect with authenticity and emotion, which are important when building a rapport and trust with others in the cohort. I bring affection, color, and texture to every interaction. People feel comfortable to communicate openly with transparency around me.

My future goals are to use these new skills to build and develop some new projects to better my local community.

### Why the TKH Innovation 

The TKH Innovation would be a tremendous oppotunity for me to discover a whole new world of innovation of the tech industry, and would equip me with resources, skills and information that otherwise would have been inaccessible to me.  I respect the mission of TKH Innovation that they function as a _social change organization who passionately believes that young people should be given the opportunity to succeed regardless of their financial circumstances or background._
